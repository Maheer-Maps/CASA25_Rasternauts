## Project Summary 

The project aims to develop an application using Google Earth Engine that policymakers can use to assess the landslide susceptibility in Nepal. The model identifies high hazard zones by using parameters like terrain, hydrology, soil, and land cover data. The model follows methodologies from  “Landslide Susceptibility Models Utilising Spatial Data Analysis Techniques” by Remondo et al. The machine learning model is also tested to validate its accuracy and practicality using the recent landslide points data from the [Bipad Portal](https://bipadportal.gov.np/incidents/) (Dates: 6-13 April, 2025).

### Problem Statement 

Nepal’s dynamic urban and rural landscapes—marked by shifting terrains, expanding settlements, and changing land uses, are rarely reflected in existing disaster management systems. Despite being highly prone to landslides, the country lacks regularly updated susceptibility maps that can guide timely interventions. This gap poses serious risks to vulnerable populations and critical infrastructure. Our application aims to bridge this disconnect by providing an accessible, up-to-date platform for policymakers, planners, and stakeholders to visualize high-risk zones, assess vulnerable people and land, and make informed decisions for mitigation and resilience. As it is better to be prepared, rather than make hasty decisions during a disaster. 

### End User 

The main end users of this application are urban local bodies, disaster management cells, and policymakers. These are the stakeholders who need updated landslide susceptibility maps to take well-informed decisions. By focusing on local municipalities, we can help ensure that structures and buildings are not violating Development Control Regulations (DCRs). Issues like poor construction practices, slope cutting, and blocked drainage networks are major contributors to landslide hazards. With this application, we aim to give authorities an easy-to-use platform where they can identify vulnerable areas and population.

## Data

- Shapefile: National boundary of Nepal

- Elevation/Slope: USGS SRTMGL1_003

- Land Cover: MODIS MCD12Q1 (2020)

- Hydrology: WWF HydroSHEDS flow accumulation

- Soil Data: OpenLandMap (texture & clay content)

- Validation: Bipad Portal landslide incident points (6–13 April 2025)

## Methodology

1. Filter shapefile to Nepal

2. Extract and clip elevation data, compute slope

3. Analyse land cover, reclassify bare land as higher risk

4. Map water flow to identify erosion-prone areas

5. Assess soil texture, emphasising clay-heavy zones

6. Normalise each factor to a 0–1 scale

7. Weight inputs: Slope (30%), Soil (20%), Rivers (10%), Elevation (10%), Land Cover (10%)

8. Combine layers using a weighted sum model

9. Visualize the risk using a red-yellow-green palette



## The Application 

The final application will run on Google Earth Engine, allowing users to visualise landslide risk across Nepal dynamically. Users can zoom in to specific districts, interpret risk zones, and potentially overlay incident data to validate model predictions. The tool is built for scalability and may be adapted for other regions facing similar geological threats.

### Interface

(How does your application's interface work to address the needs of your end user?)
### How it Works 

#### 1. Data Preparation and Selection

![Loading Data, 2025](images/1_Load and look at data.png)

The model begins by importing a shapefile defining Nepal’s boundaries, ensuring all subsequent datasets are spatially clipped to the relevant region. Various geospatial catalogues are explored for coverage, accuracy, and temporal relevance. USGS SRTM is selected for elevation and slope analysis due to its global 30m resolution. MODIS land cover data from 2020 is chosen for consistency and recency. WWF HydroSHEDS is used for hydrology, while OpenLandMap provides soil texture and clay content. These layers form the basis of our model, chosen specifically for their compatibility, open access, and prior use in landslide risk assessments globally.

#### 2. Risk Factor Normalisation and Weighting

![Normalizing and Weighting Data, 2025](images/2_Making_The_Model.png)

Following the methodology from Remondo et al. (Spain, 2005), each input layer is normalised to a 0–1 range to ensure comparability across variables. The normalisation spans values specific to Nepal’s topography and environmental conditions. Slope is weighted highest (30%) as steep terrain correlates strongly with landslide incidence. Soil texture and clay fraction contribute 20%, given their influence on water retention. Distance to streams (10%) accounts for erosion potential, while elevation (10%) and land cover (10%) further contextualise surface vulnerability. MODIS data from 2020 is used to match the spatial timeframe of recent events. These weights reflect empirical evidence and expert judgement.

#### 3. Integrating Incident Points from Bipad Portal

![Incident Points in GEE, 2025](images/4_GeoJson Points.png)

To validate the model, recent landslide incidents (6–13 April 2025) are scraped from Nepal’s Bipad Portal, which maintains a national disaster event database. Using spatial extraction tools and basic automation, the event point data is converted into a GeoJSON format. This is then uploaded into Google Earth Engine for visual comparison against the model output. These points represent ground-truth observations and are critical for assessing whether high-risk zones in the application align with actual landslide locations. This step bridges remote sensing with on-the-ground incident reporting and provides the foundation for further accuracy testing.

#### 4. Visualising Risk Through the Interface
The application’s output is presented as a single raster layer showing normalised landslide risk. A simple and intuitive interface uses a traffic light colour scheme: green indicates low risk, yellow moderate, and red signifies high-risk areas. This gradient approach makes the output accessible to non-specialists, including government officers and local planners. Users can interactively pan, zoom, and inspect any region of Nepal in real-time via Google Earth Engine. Additional layers, such as slope or soil texture, can be toggled for in-depth analysis. This visual clarity supports both strategic planning and emergency response.

#### 5. Validation, Testing and Potential Expansion
The application’s accuracy will be tested by comparing the predicted high-risk zones against actual landslide points from the Bipad dataset. We will calculate metrics like true positive rate and explore false negatives. If feasible, a Random Forest classifier may be trained using the incident data combined with randomly sampled no-landslide points, incorporating the same environmental variables. This would provide a machine learning-based susceptibility map for comparison with our weighted model. The end goal is to assess both models’ strengths and explore whether hybrid or ensemble techniques could offer improved precision for future applications.
