## Project Summary

The project aims to develop an application using Google Earth Engine that policymakers can use to assess the landslide susceptibility in Nepal. The model identifies high hazard zones by using parameters like terrain, hydrology, soil, and land cover data. The model follows methodologies from “Use of satellite remote sensing data in the mapping of global landslide susceptibility” by Hong et al (2007). The machine learning model is also tested to validate its accuracy and practicality using the recent landslide points data from the [Bipad Portal](https://bipadportal.gov.np/incidents/) (Dates: 6-13 April, 2025).

### Problem Statement

Almost 80% of the total area of Nepal is prone to landslides (Department of Water Induced Disaster Prevention, 2015), so easily accessible research into which areas are most susceptible is motivated. Updating research to find which factors make areas most vulnerable to damaging landslides in Nepal provides information on the locations of vulnerable populations and critical infrastructure. This research must be easily interpretable for academics and, crucially, local administrators. Our application aims to bridge this disconnect by providing an accessible, Nepali-language platform for policymakers, planners, and stakeholders to visualize high susceptibility zones, and make informed decisions for mitigation and resilience.

### End User

Our platform is designed for hybrid users across academia and specific administrative bodies involved in landslide management in Nepal. These users require scientifically robust yet accessible tools to develop policies. In the past, the gap between academic knowledge and local awareness limited the practical benefits of research—as seen during the 2015 earthquake and 2021 Melamchi floods. By delivering these models through a Nepali default website rather than papers, we aim to improve accessibility, utility, and real-world impact for those affected by landslides and responsible for crisis response.

## Methodology

### Susceptibility Model

To recreate Hong et al.'s susceptibility model in GEE, we imported six environmental variables into a weighted linear combination. Each variable was normalized on a 0-1 scale, and in combination with the weights provided a susceptibility score for each pixel. Susceptibility was then normalized 0-1 for the whole of Nepal.

### Random Forest Model

To find populated areas most susceptible to landslides, we masked our environmental variables to populated areas, and trained a random forest classifier on landslide and randomly generated non-landslide points from Bipad Portal. Each pixel was scored based on the proportion of decision trees voting landslide.

## The Application

### How it Works

#### 1. Data Preparation and Precomputations

To handle complex computations, separate scripts were developed for the two methodologies explained above. Results are imported into the app as precomputed layers.

**Imported Precomputed Layers:**

-   Environmental Landslide Susceptibility: Maps susceptibility using environmental variables.

-   Normalized Landslide Susceptibility: Adjusted for population exposure.

-   Random Forest Landslide Probability: ML-based risk focused on populated areas.

**District-Level Aggregation:**

A dedicated script was built to aggregate historical reported landslide data with impact metrics (e.g., incidents, deaths, injuries, destroyed infrastructure), alongside population and susceptibility metrics per district. It also includes engineered metrics such as incidents per km² and nearest districts (determined via spatial proximity of centroids) for comparative analysis.

``` javascript
  // Compute distances to other districts and find two nearest neighbors using precomputed centroids
  var districtsWithDistance = districtFactors.map(function(otherDistrict) {
    var otherName = otherDistrict.get('DISTRICT');
    var lon2 = ee.Number(otherDistrict.get('centroid_lon'));
    var lat2 = ee.Number(otherDistrict.get('centroid_lat'));

    // Approximate distance using Euclidean distance in lat/lon 
    var distance = lon1.subtract(lon2).pow(2).add(lat1.subtract(lat2).pow(2)).sqrt();
    return otherDistrict.set('distance', distance);
  });

  var nearbyDistricts = districtsWithDistance
    .filter(ee.Filter.neq('DISTRICT', districtName))
    .sort('distance')
    .limit(2);

  // Extract the two nearest neighbors
  var neighbor1 = nearbyDistricts.first();
  var neighbor2 = nearbyDistricts.toList(2).get(1);
```

#### 2. Interactive Visualization and Analysis

#### National Overview

At startup, national-level statistics are displayed, highlighting aggregated data. A pie chart shows population risk distribution across susceptibility zones (Low, Medium, High), and a bar chart lists the top 5 districts by impact metric, allowing users to switch metrics and zoom into a district by clicking a bar.

##### **susceptibility zones**

Susceptibility zones are defined as Low (\<0.3), Medium (0.3–0.5), and High (\>0.5), identified by analyzing the distribution of susceptibility values from the built Susceptibility model.

``` javascript

// Generate a histogram of susceptibility values
var histogram = LandslideSusceptibility.reduceRegion({
  reducer: ee.Reducer.histogram({min: 0, max: 1, steps: 100}),
  geometry: NepalBoundary.geometry(),
  scale: 1000, // Match the scale used in the app for consistency
  maxPixels: 1e10,
  bestEffort: true
});

// Extract the histogram data
var histogramDict = ee.Dictionary(histogram.get('susceptibility'));
var values = ee.List(histogramDict.get('histogram')); // Frequency counts
var bucketEdges = ee.List(histogramDict.get('bucketMeans')); // Bin centers

// Print the histogram for analysis
print('Histogram of Susceptibility Values:', histogram);

// Define susceptibility zones based on histogram-derived thresholds
var thresholdZones = LandslideSusceptibility
  .where(LandslideSusceptibility.lt(0.3), 1) // Low Risk: < 0.3
  .where(LandslideSusceptibility.gte(0.3).and(LandslideSusceptibility.select('slope').lte(0.5)), 2) // Medium Risk: 0.3–0.5
  .where(LandslideSusceptibility.gt(0.5), 3) // High Risk: > 0.5
  .rename('zone')
  .updateMask(LandslideSusceptibility.mask())
  .clip(NepalBoundary);
```

#### District-Level Analysis:

This view provides detailed district analysis, showing key metrics like average susceptibility, population, and incidents per km², alongside comparisons with national averages and the two nearest districts. Historical landslides are visualized on the map, with popups displaying aggregated details (e.g., deaths, injuries) within a 300m radius of a clicked point.

#### Methodology overview:

This views allows user to understand the two methodological approaches and compare compares the RF probability map and normalized risk map using split panel

This view allows users to compare the two methodologies (Environmental Susceptibility and RF) using a split panel. It displays the RF probability map and normalized risk map for populated areas, with a draggable divider for spatial comparison, focusing on population exposure.

``` javascript
// Initialize split maps with layers
var leftMap = ui.Map();
var rightMap = ui.Map();

// Add risk layers to split maps
var leftProbabilityLayer = ui.Map.Layer(probabilityLayer.getEeObject(), probabilityLayer.getVisParams(), translate('RF Landslide Probability (Populated Areas)'));
leftMap.layers().add(leftProbabilityLayer);
var rightNormalizedRiskLayer = ui.Map.Layer(normalizedRiskLayer.getEeObject(), normalizedRiskLayer.getVisParams(), translate('Landslide Susceptibility (Populated Areas)'));
rightMap.layers().add(rightNormalizedRiskLayer);

// Link maps for synchronized zooming and panning
var mapLinker = ui.Map.Linker([leftMap, rightMap]);

// Set up the split panel for comparison
var splitPanel = ui.SplitPanel({
 firstPanel: leftMap,
 secondPanel: rightMap,
 orientation: 'horizontal',
 wipe: true
});
```

#### 3. insights and objectives

The app provides actionable insights for disaster preparedness in Nepal by identifying high-risk districts and population exposure. It supports:

-   Risk Prioritization: Highlights districts with high susceptibility or incident rates (e.g., top 5 districts by deaths) to guide resource allocation.

-   Localized Insights: Enables district-level analysis for targeted planning and response, benefiting community preparedness efforts.

-   Academic Research: Unlike traditional landslide models in academic papers, this app provides an interactive platform for exploring risk dynamics through a comparison of Environmental Susceptibility and Random Forest methodologies, leveraging incidents data. By masking to populated areas, it focuses on human exposure, as official records often under-report incidents in uninhabited regions, ensuring more accurate risk assessment and model comparison for populated zones.

#### **4. Limitations and Potential Expansion**

-   **Model Variables:** The Environmental Susceptibility model uses six variables—slope, elevation, land cover, soil texture, clay content, and drainage density—with weights derived from literature. Future improvements could involve a more comprehensive literature review to identify additional influential factors and the integration of advanced modeling techniques.

-   **Static Models:** Current models are precomputed, limiting adaptability to changing environmental conditions. Adding dynamic updates with live data (e.g., rainfall, land use changes) could improve accuracy and responsiveness.

-   **Granularity of Analysis:** The app focuses on district-level analysis, but more granular insights (e.g., at the village or ward level) could improve localized planning

-   **Report Export:** The app lacks a feature to export analysis reports, which would be valuable for stakeholders to document and share findings.

### Demo

The application runs on Google Earth Engine, allowing users to visualise landslide risk across Nepal dynamically. Users can zoom in to specific districts, interpret risk zones, and overlay incident data to validate model predictions. The tool is built for scalability and may be adapted for other regions facing similar geological threats.
