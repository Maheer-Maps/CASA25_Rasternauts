## Project Summary 

The project aims to develop an application using Google Earth Engine that policymakers can use to assess the landslide susceptibility in Nepal. The model identifies high hazard zones by using parameters like terrain, hydrology, soil, and land cover data. The model follows methodologies from  “Use of satellite remote sensing data in the mapping of global landslide susceptibility” by Hong et al (2007). The machine learning model is also tested to validate its accuracy and practicality using the recent landslide points data from the [Bipad Portal](https://bipadportal.gov.np/incidents/) (Dates: 6-13 April, 2025).

### Problem Statement 

Nepal’s dynamic urban and rural landscapes—marked by shifting terrains, expanding settlements, and changing land uses, are rarely reflected in existing disaster management systems. Despite being highly prone to landslides, the country lacks regularly updated susceptibility maps that can guide timely interventions. This gap poses serious risks to vulnerable populations and critical infrastructure. Our application aims to bridge this disconnect by providing an accessible, up-to-date platform for policymakers, planners, and stakeholders to visualize high-risk zones, assess vulnerable people and land, and make informed decisions for mitigation and resilience. As it is better to be prepared, rather than make hasty decisions during a disaster. 

### End User 

The main end users of this application are urban local bodies, disaster management cells, and policymakers. These are the stakeholders who need updated landslide susceptibility maps to take well-informed decisions. By focusing on local municipalities, we can help ensure that structures and buildings are not violating Development Control Regulations (DCRs). Issues like poor construction practices, slope cutting, and blocked drainage networks are major contributors to landslide hazards. With this application, we aim to give authorities an easy-to-use platform where they can identify vulnerable areas and population.

## Methodology

### Susceptibility Model

To recreate Hong et al.'s susceptibility model in GEE, we computed six environmental variables and imported them into a weighted linear combination. Each variable was assigned a weight and normalized on a 0-1 scale, and the combination of weights provided a susceptibility score for each pixel. Susceptibility was then normalized 0-1 for the whole of Nepal.

### Random Forest Model



## The Application 

The final application will run on Google Earth Engine, allowing users to visualise landslide risk across Nepal dynamically. Users can zoom in to specific districts, interpret risk zones, and potentially overlay incident data to validate model predictions. The tool is built for scalability and may be adapted for other regions facing similar geological threats.

### Interface

(How does your application's interface work to address the needs of your end user?)
### How it Works 

#### 1. Data Preparation and Selection

![Loading Data, 2025](images/1_Load and look at data.png)

This model clips Hong et al.'s landslide susceptibility model to Nepal's boundaries. Greater slope and elevation, as calculated from NASA SRTM Digital Elevation, are associated with higher susceptibility. Looser, coarser soil texture, from OpenLandMap Soil Texture Class, is associated with higher susceptibility. A soil type with more clay, from OpenLandMap Clay Content, is associated with higher susceptibility. Greater drainage density, from WWF HydroSHEDS flow accumulation, is associated with lower susceptibility. Each MODIS land cover type was assigned a susceptibility value by Hong et al.

#### 2. Risk Factor Normalisation and Weighting

![Normalizing and Weighting Data, 2025](images/2_Making_The_Model.png)

Following the methodology from Hong et al. (2007), each input layer is normalised to a 0–1 range to ensure comparability across variables. The normalisation spans values specific to Nepal’s topography and environmental conditions. Slope is weighted at 0.3 as steep terrain has the strongest influence. Soil texture and soil type (clay percentage) are both weighted at 0.2. Drainage density, elevation, and land cover are each weighted at 0.1. These weights were developed by Hong et al. by testing which global weights best aligned with regional susceptibility maps.

#### 3. Integrating Incident Points from Bipad Portal

![Incident Points in GEE, 2025](images/4_GeoJson Points.png)

To validate the model, recent landslide incidents (6–13 April 2025) are scraped from Nepal’s Bipad Portal, which maintains a national disaster event database. Using spatial extraction tools and basic automation, the event point data is converted into a GeoJSON format. This is then uploaded into Google Earth Engine for visual comparison against the model output. These points represent ground-truth observations and are critical for assessing whether high-risk zones in the application align with actual landslide locations. This step bridges remote sensing with on-the-ground incident reporting and provides the foundation for further accuracy testing.

#### 4. Visualising Risk Through the Interface
The application’s output is presented as a single raster layer showing normalised landslide risk. A simple and intuitive interface uses a traffic light colour scheme: green indicates low risk, yellow moderate, and red signifies high-risk areas. This gradient approach makes the output accessible to non-specialists, including government officers and local planners. Users can interactively pan, zoom, and inspect any region of Nepal in real-time via Google Earth Engine. Additional layers, such as slope or soil texture, can be toggled for in-depth analysis. This visual clarity supports both strategic planning and emergency response.

#### 5. Validation, Testing and Potential Expansion
The application’s accuracy will be tested by comparing the predicted high-risk zones against actual landslide points from the Bipad dataset. We will calculate metrics like true positive rate and explore false negatives. If feasible, a Random Forest classifier may be trained using the incident data combined with randomly sampled no-landslide points, incorporating the same environmental variables. This would provide a machine learning-based susceptibility map for comparison with our weighted model. The end goal is to assess both models’ strengths and explore whether hybrid or ensemble techniques could offer improved precision for future applications.
