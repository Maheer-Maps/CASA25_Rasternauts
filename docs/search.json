Susceptibility was then normalized 0-1 for the whole of Nepal.\n\n\n\nSusceptibility Model Methodology\n\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Model\nTo find populated areas most susceptible to landslides, we masked our environmental variables to populated areas, and trained a random forest classifier on landslide and randomly generated non-landslide points from Bipad Portal.

    "section": "The Application",
    "text": "The Application\nThe application runs on Google Earth Engine, allowing users to visualise landslide risk across Nepal dynamically. Users can zoom in to specific districts, interpret risk zones, and overlay incident data to validate model predictions. The tool is built for scalability and may be adapted for other regions facing similar geological threats.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n1. Data Preparation and Selection\n\n\n\nLoading Data, 2025\n\n\nThis model clips Hong et al.’s landslide susceptibility model to Nepal’s boundaries. Greater slope and elevation, as calculated from NASA SRTM Digital Elevation, are associated with higher susceptibility. Looser, coarser soil texture, from OpenLandMap Soil Texture Class, is associated with higher susceptibility. A soil type with more clay, from OpenLandMap Clay Content, is associated with higher susceptibility. Greater drainage density, from WWF HydroSHEDS flow accumulation, is associated with lower susceptibility. Each MODIS land cover type was assigned a susceptibility value by Hong et al.\n\n\n2. Risk Factor Normalisation and Weighting\n\n\n\nNormalizing and Weighting Data, 2025\n\n\nFollowing the methodology from Hong et al. (2007), each input layer is normalised to a 0–1 range to ensure comparability across variables. The normalisation spans values specific to Nepal’s topography and environmental conditions. Slope is weighted at 0.3 as steep terrain has the strongest influence. Soil texture and soil type (clay percentage) are both weighted at 0.2. Drainage density, elevation, and land cover are each weighted at 0.1. These weights were developed by Hong et al. by testing which global weights best aligned with regional susceptibility maps.\n\n\n3. Integrating Incident Points from Bipad Portal\n\n\n\nIncident Points in GEE, 2025\n\n\nTo validate the model, recent landslide incidents (6–13 April 2025) are scraped from Nepal’s Bipad Portal, which maintains a national disaster event database. Using spatial extraction tools and basic automation, the event point data is converted into a GeoJSON format. This is then uploaded into Google Earth Engine for visual comparison against the model output. These points represent ground-truth observations and are critical for assessing whether high-risk zones in the application align with actual landslide locations. This step bridges remote sensing with on-the-ground incident reporting and provides the foundation for further accuracy testing.\n\n\n4. Visualising Risk Through the Interface\nThe application’s output is presented as a single raster layer showing normalised landslide risk. A simple and intuitive interface uses a traffic light colour scheme: green indicates low risk, yellow moderate, and red signifies high-risk areas. This gradient approach makes the output accessible to non-specialists, including government officers and local planners. Users can interactively pan, zoom, and inspect any region of Nepal in real-time via Google Earth Engine. Additional layers, such as slope or soil texture, can be toggled for in-depth analysis. This visual clarity supports both strategic planning and emergency response.\n\n\n5. Validation, Testing and Potential Expansion\nThe application’s accuracy will be tested by comparing the predicted high-risk zones against actual landslide points from the Bipad dataset. We will calculate metrics like true positive rate and explore false negatives. If feasible, a Random Forest classifier may be trained using the incident data combined with randomly sampled no-landslide points, incorporating the same environmental variables. This would provide a machine learning-based susceptibility map for comparison with our weighted model. The end goal is to assess both models’ strengths and explore whether hybrid or ensemble techniques could offer improved precision for future applications."
