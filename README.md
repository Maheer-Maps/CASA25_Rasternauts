# Nepal Landslides Risk Assessment Tool - CASA0025 Assignment

Welcome to the repository for the Nepal Landslides Risk Assessment Tool, a web-based application built using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to assess landslide susceptibility and risk across Nepal. By leveraging big data, the tool provides critical insights to support disaster preparedness and planning in a region highly vulnerable to landslides.


This repository hosts a Quarto website that documents the project, detailing the app’s development, functionality, and insights. The app itself provides national and district-level analyses of landslide risks, historical incidents, and population exposure, with a focus on accessibility, performance, and user interaction through multilingual support and intuitive visualizations. [Explore the website here](https://maheer-maps.github.io/CASA25_Rasternauts/) to learn more about our methodology, data sources, and the app’s features.

## Precomputations Folder

The `precomputations` folder contains scripts used to generate the datasets powering the app, such as district-level risk factors and the landslide susceptibility model. These scripts process raw geospatial data and upload the results as GEE assets, which the app then uses for analysis and visualization.
